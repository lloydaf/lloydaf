### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to see you here! I'm Lloyd, and I'm a FullStack Developer! :neckbeard:

Most of my work has been with [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Express](https://expressjs.com), and I'm currently working with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)!

I've written an [npm](https://npmjs.org) tool that can be used to convert relative paths into absolute paths for TypeScript projects, and you can find that [here](https://github.com/lloydaf/unrelate) or on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unrelate).

If you use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can also install the extension for that [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lloydaf.unrelate-vscode)

I love open source, and I hope you love it too! Feel free to contribute to any of the repositories here. Have fun! :v:
